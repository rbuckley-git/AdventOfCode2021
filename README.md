# AdventOfCode2021

Update 7/12/2021 - going ok so far and keeping up with the kiddies through a little evening slog each day. Only getting time in the evening when the kids have gone to bed. Tend to solve the puzzle then spend a few minutes tidying the code and adding comments before committing. Good so far.
